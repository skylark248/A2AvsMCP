# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-28)

**Core value:** A side-by-side, runnable comparison that makes the differences between MCP and A2A visible — not described, not diagrammed, but live and traceable.
**Current focus:** Defining v2.0 requirements

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-04-28 — Milestone v2.0 started

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. v1.0 per-plan decision history retained in `.planning/milestones/v1.0-phases/*/`.

Carried into v2.0:
- Race Demo design: 2-lane Pure-MCP vs Pure-A2A + Hybrid restored to v1 scope (CEO+eng+design-cleared, iter 3, 8.5/10)
- Recovery state machine K=3 confirmed; multi-task calibration (TODO 8) promoted into v2 scope
- OG image generation via Playwright headless (TODO 3) promoted into v2 scope
- DESIGN.md lock via /design-consultation (TODO 5) promoted into v2 scope
- SDK migrations (SDK-01/02) deferred to v2.1+ — too risky alongside Race Demo

### Pending Todos

7 deferred items in `TODOS.md` (project root) post-v2-promotion:
- TODO 1 (real plan-emitter hybrid)
- TODO 2 (multi-seed benchmark)
- TODO 4 (trace schema migrator)
- TODO 6 (display typeface)
- TODO 7 (heatmap rows from enum)
- TODO 9 (HMAC PNG URLs)
- TODO 10 (LLM-judge recovery)

### Blockers/Concerns

None — defining requirements.

## Deferred Items (carried from v1.0)

Items acknowledged at v1.0 close that remain deferred into v2.0+:

| Category | Item | Status | Source |
|----------|------|--------|--------|
| Verification | Phase 5 missing VERIFICATION.md | Wired per integration check; bookkeeping gap | v1.0 audit |
| Verification | Phase 4 — 3 visual verification items | Code-level verified; visual checks deferred to demo-day rehearsal | v1.0 audit |
| SDK | SDK-01: A2A SDK 1.0.0 migration | v2.1+ backlog | Init |
| SDK | SDK-02: MCP SDK v2 migration (`FastMCP` → `McpServer`) | v2.1+ backlog | Init |
| Plan Review | TODOs 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10 in TODOS.md | v2.1+ candidates per promote conditions | Plan reviews |

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-04-28
Stopped at: Milestone v2.0 started; gathering requirements
