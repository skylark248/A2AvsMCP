# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-22)

**Core value:** A side-by-side, runnable comparison that makes the differences between MCP and A2A visible — not described, not diagrammed, but live and traceable.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Demo Stability Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Demo Stability Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 2 in current phase
Status: Planned — ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-04-22 — Phase 1 plans created and verified (2 plans, 2 waves)

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Init: Lock demo day to `runtime=mock, transport=in_process` — only fully-tested, crash-safe transport path
- Init: Pin `mcp>=1.27,<2` and `a2a-sdk==0.3.26` for this milestone; defer SDK major migrations to v2
- Init: Add new scenarios as `DemoRepository` entries — fits existing dispatch pattern without infrastructure changes

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- TRACE-05 (trace view tiers) must be complete before Phase 3 scenarios are built — new scenarios will produce 60-120+ events
- `timeout_ms=1500` in `A2ABroker` is too low for parallel dispatch (TRACE-04 addresses this in Phase 2)

## Deferred Items

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Scenarios | DISC-01/02: Tool discovery scenario + DiscoveryPhasePanel | v2 backlog | Init |
| SDK | SDK-01: A2A SDK 1.0.0 migration | v2 backlog | Init |
| SDK | SDK-02: MCP SDK v2 migration | v2 backlog | Init |
| Visualization | VIZ-01: Annotated diff view | v2 backlog | Init |
| Visualization | VIZ-02: Interactive sequence diagram | v2 backlog | Init |
